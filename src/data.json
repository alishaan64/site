    "Last year, we ran <a hrefCincyHacks, Cincinnati’s largest high school hackathon. CincyHacks was a massive success —  we had over 80 students present 16 different ideas. This year, we’re kicking it up a notch: we’re bringing in leaders from Hack Camp, Hack Chicago, McDonogh Hacks, and CodeDay to run an event for 300 high school programmers, hackers, and designers.",
    "As one of those 300 hackers, you’ll work in a team for 24 hours to create your own project — be it an app, game, or website. To help, we’ll provide free food, swag, mentorship, and workshops. At the end of the event, your team will present to a panel of judges for a chance to win some fabulous prizes."
