      "title": "About Us",
      "description": "Hack Cincinnati was born out of a mission to uncover the passion for computer science in the Midwest. We’re carrying on the mission started by Hack Chicago last year. We believe that that attending a hackathon is one of the most valuable experiences a high school programmer can have."

      "title": "What You'll Do",
      "description": "As one of 300 hackers, you’ll work in a team for 24 hours to create your own project — be it an app, game, or website. To help, we’ll provide free food, swag, mentorship, and workshops. At the end of the event, your team will present to a panel of judges for a chance to win some fabulous prizes."

    "featureThree": {
      "title": "Why Hack Cincinnati?",
      "description": "Hack Cincinnati aims to be inclusive to all skill levels. As a beginner, you could attend one of the workshops designed to jump-start your project. If you’re a veteran hacker, we’ll provide personalized mentorship to help refine your skills. We also have numerous non-coding events planned to give your mind (and fingers!) a much-needed break."
